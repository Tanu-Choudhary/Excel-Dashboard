## How the Dashboard Works  

### 1. KPI Metrics for Business Overview  
-  **Objective:** Calculate and display Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin dynamically.

   **Steps:**
   1. Import the **Orders Table** into Excel using Power Query.
   2. Create calculated columns for:
      - `Profit Margin` = `Profit / Sales`.
      - `Total Orders` = Count of `Order ID`.
   3. Use Excel formulas to calculate:
      - `Total Sales` = `=SUM(Sales)`.
      - `Total Profit` = `=SUM(Profit)`.
      - `Total Quantity` = `=SUM(Quantity)`.
   4. Build a dynamic KPI table and use symbols to enhance visual appeal (e.g., ðŸ’° for Total Sales).
